# LoginScreen
This was my final project in my computer science three class at West Chester University.  The goal was to create a login screen that would be able to take you to other
screens that you created.  I made this projects using scence builder which involves both coding and drag and dropping items from the builder to create your login screen.
*Note* the main method is within interaction if you wish to try to run the program.
